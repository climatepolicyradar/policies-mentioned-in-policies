Solar energy systems have been\nsuccessfully introduced in the last decade, namely with the support of the World Bank (WB), the\nGlobal Environmental Facility (GEF) and the Rural Electrification Fund (REF). It is worth mentioning\nthat nearly 10% of rural energy supply is nowadays provided by renewable energies.\n\u2022 Policy achievements. The GoM's vision and targets have been formulated in key policy papers.\nThese are: (i) the National Energy Policy (2006); (ii) the National Strategy for the Development of\nRenewable Energies (2006); (iii) the National Strategy for the Development of Biofuels (2006); and\n(iv) the National Energy Sector Policy Letter (2009-2012).\nInstitutional achievements. In recognition of the crosscutting dimension of energy, Mali has\ncreated and strengthened a number of institutions that play key roles in the development of the\nrenewable energy sub-sector. The Prime Minister Cabinet is directly involved through the\nsupervision of the Commission for Electricity and Water Regulations and of a number of\ndepartments and agencies. The National Energy Directorate (DNE) formulates national energy\npolicies and ensures the coordination and technical supervision of regional and sub-regional\ndepartments. Electricity services are essentially provided by EDM and by local private energy\ncompanies supported by the AMADER and the Rural Electrification Fund. Other important\ninstitutions in the sector include the National Research Center for Solar and Renewable Energy\n(CNESOLER) and the National Agency for the Development of Biofuels (ANADEB).\nEnvironmental and Social achievements. Environmental and social impacts of energy projects\nfollow standard national review procedures under the Ministry of Environment; safeguard\nframeworks acceptable to MDB requirements are in place for rural energy projects. A National\nClimate Change Strategy has been finalized in September 2011. Considerable potential for gender\nspecific activities in rural electrification, that are inherently linked to productive energy uses and\nthe strengthening of the public private partnership between local energy service providers and\nnational agencies, are been identified in a gender assessment financed by World Bank and will be\nfurther strengthened under the IP.\n\u2022 Rural energy access expansion achievements: The GoM launched an ambitious rural energy access\nprogram in the last decade to achieve the rural electrification goals set in the National Energy\nPolicy.

The Commission communication of 22 November 2016 on the next steps for a sustainable European future links the SDGs to the Union policy framework to ensure that all Union actions and policy initiatives, both within the Union and globally, take the SDGs on board at the outset. In its conclusions of 20 June 2017 the Council confirmed the commitment of the Union and its Member States to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in a full, coherent, comprehensive, integrated and effective manner, in close cooperation with partners and other stakeholders.

The Green Deal is the new growth strategy of the Union. It aims to transform the Union into a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy with no net emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) by 2050. It also aims to protect, conserve and enhance the Union's natural capital, and protect the health and well-being of Union citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. The Green Deal aims to decouple economic growth from resource use, and ensure that all regions and Union citizens participate in a socially just transition to a sustainable economic system whereby no person and no place is left behind. It will contribute to the objective of building an economy that works for the people, strengthening the Union\u2019s social market economy, helping to ensure that it is ready for the future and that it delivers stability, jobs, growth and sustainable investment."

Companies that eliminate methane emissions may be\neligible for partially repayable contributions, meaning that a portion of the funding is forgiven based on\nthe cost per tonne of emission reductions. The cheaper the project on a cost per tonne basis, the more\nthat can be forgiven, up to 50% of the total project cost. This will greatly benefit the environment, and\nworkers and communities involved in the oil and gas industry. It will also contribute to the achievement\nof Canada's target to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40-45% by the year 2025\nand lay the foundation for additional reductions in 2030 and 2035.\n\u2022 Use proceeds collected from the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS) for industry to further support\nindustrial projects to cut emissions and use new cleaner technologies and processes, as part of the plan\nto decarbonize industrial sectors.

Development of the power sector has also to meet the\nchallenge of providing access for electricity to all households in next five years.\nIt is therefore essential to attract adequate investments in the power sector by\nproviding appropriate return on investment as budgetary resources of the Central\nand State Governments are incapable of providing the requisite funds. It is\nequally necessary to ensure availability of electricity to different categories of\nconsumers at reasonable rates for achieving the objectives of rapid economic\ndevelopment of the country and improvement in the living standards of the\npeople.\nBalancing the requirement of attracting adequate investments to the sector and\nthat of ensuring reasonability of user charges for the consumers is the critical\nchallenge for the regulatory process. Accelerated development of the power\nsector and its ability to attract necessary investments calls for, inter alia, consistent\nregulatory approach across the country. Consistency in approach becomes all\nthe more necessary considering the large number of States and the diversities\ninvolved.\nLEGAL POSITION\n2.1 Section 3 (1) of the Electricity Act 2003 empowers the Central Government to\nformulate the tariff policy. Section 3 (3) of the Act enables the Central Government\nto review or revise the tariff policy from time to time."

In its communication of 11 December 2019 on the European Green Deal, the Commission set out a new growth strategy that aims to transform the Union into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy built on sustainable and rule-based free trade, where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050, where economic growth is decoupled from resource use and no person or place is left behind. It aims to protect, conserve and enhance the Union\u2019s natural capital, and protect the health and well-being of citizens and future generations from environment-related risks and impacts. Furthermore, the European Green Deal aims to provide citizens and future generations with, inter alia, fresh air, clean water, healthy soil and biodiversity.

Development of the power sector has also to meet the\nchallenge of providing access for electricity to all households in next five years.\nIt is therefore essential to attract adequate investments in the power sector by\nproviding appropriate return on investment as budgetary resources of the Central\nand State Governments are incapable of providing the requisite funds. It is\nequally necessary to ensure availability of electricity to different categories of\nconsumers at reasonable rates for achieving the objectives of rapid economic\ndevelopment of the country and improvement in the living standards of the\npeople.\nBalancing the requirement of attracting adequate investments to the sector and\nthat of ensuring reasonability of user charges for the consumers is the critical\nchallenge for the regulatory process. Accelerated development of the power\nsector and its ability to attract necessary investments calls for, inter alia, consistent\nregulatory approach across the country. Consistency in approach becomes all\nthe more necessary considering the large number of States and the diversities\ninvolved.\nLEGAL POSITION\n2.1 Section 3 (1) of the Electricity Act 2003 empowers the Central Government to\nformulate the tariff policy. Section 3 (3) of the Act enables the Central Government\nto review or revise the tariff policy from time to time."

In the future, we will position hydrogen as a new resource and involve a wide range of players, not just for passenger cars. On that basis, for example, in each field of utilization, transportation, and manufacturing, we estimate the size of the world market based on certain hypotheses, and take various measures as described below to promote decarbonization. , to strengthen industrial competitiveness. To that end, we will reduce the supply cost to 30 yen/Nm\u00b2 in 2030 (less than 1/3 of the current selling price) by 2030, and reduce the hydrogen power generation cost to below gas-fired power generation in 2050 (approximately 20 yen/Nm\u00b2 or less) by increasing the amount of hydrogen introduced. etc., to achieve a level that is sufficiently competitive with fossil fuels. With regard to the target volume, while recognizing that each country and region has different situations in terms of renewable energy potential and market size, it is important to establish the domestic hydrogen market early."

Overall, this reduction amounts to around one fifth of the emissions, per capita even 40 percent. The CO\u2082 Act, the Emissions Trading Act, the energy strategy via measures in the Energy Efficiency Act and energy regulations for buildings all contributed to this. However, greenhouse gas emissions are not only caused locally, but also through the consumption of imported goods. For Liechtenstein with its highly globalized economy, these emissions generated abroad (so-called &quot;grey emissions&quot;) are of central importance - they account for more than twice the domestic emissions. Important drivers for reducing emissions are technological developments, digitization and green investments in the financial industry. As all countries gradually set increasingly ambitious climate targets as a result of the Paris climate agreement, new markets for innovation and technology developments will emerge over the next five to ten years."

Background\nEnergy and Mines are key sectors for Cambodia's social and economic development, playing an important\nrole in poverty reduction efforts in particular, through infrastructure development and job creation. The\nMinistry of Mines and Energy (MME) is the governmental institution mandated to oversee the two sectors,\nbeing responsible for establishing the relevant policy and legal and regulatory frameworks, as well as for\nplanning, programming and developing infrastructure and foster the development of the sectors building\ncooperation with diverse partners.\nIn 2013, the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) launched the Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan\n2014-2023 (CCCSP), providing an overall framework for climate change response and the integration of\nclimate change issues into development planning at national and sectoral levels. As a result, technical line\nministries have developed climate change action plans to operationalize the CCCSP in their respective\nsectors, thus contributing to a coordinated effort to address climate change issues in Cambodia.\nThe Ministry Mines and Energy has developed the Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) for 2016-2018\nfollowing guidance from the Council of Ministers, and with the support from the National Council for\nSustainable Development (NCSD) and technical and financial support from Cambodia Climate Change\nAlliance (CCCA). The process for developing the CCAP involved a series of consultations with all technical\nand planning departments of MME, as well as with other ministries, development partners, private sector\nand other relevant stakeholders, ensuring alignment with the sectors' strategies, policies and plans, as well\nas with national development goals.\nThe present CCAP defines concrete actions and resources needed for the operationalization of the MME's\nresponse to climate change for the period 2016-2018, providing direction on a number of issues which are\ncritical to the sectors' development, including climate proofing of existing and future energy infrastructure,\ndecoupling economic growth and sectors' future development from GHG emissions, and how to build the\nsector's capacity to meet the country's commitments on the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) (11.\nA. Policy\nIn 2007, the Rural Electrification by Renewable Energy Policy was integrated into the government's overall\nagenda for the energy sector. Providing reliable, affordable and adequate supply of electric power for the\nconsumers can be pointed out as the prime focus of this national policy. Moreover, promoting private\nownership of electrical facilities and encouraging competition among the companies in the energy sector is\nanother focus of the national policy on energy [2].\nEnabling 70% of rural households to reach reliable electricity services by 2030 is one of the long-term\ntargets of the RGC. The government focuses on providing energy services and improving the quality of life\nfor the rural population in two main policies: Energy Sector Development Policy and Rural Electrification\nPolicy. Development of renewable energies is one of the approaches adopted to meet the mentioned\nobjective. Rural Electrification Fund (REF) subsidy and investment incentives are two main policy\ninstruments to support implementation of the Energy Sector Development and Rural Electrification Policies\nfinancially. Based on the REF documents among the renewable technologies, the only Solar Home Systems\n(SHSS) and mini/micro hydropower are qualified for subsidies scheme [36]. In order to reach the long-\nterm goal, a 10-year target was developed as the medium term to connect 25% of households to the\nelectrical service. It can be clearly observed that the development of electricity generation and\ntransmission was taken into account from 1994 by electricity sector development policy. The electrification\ntrend was followed by several policies with the main objective of rural electrification. Some of the\n1\nsay"

Further amendments to the Tariff Policy were notified on 31 March, 2008, 20 January,\n2011 and 8th July, 2011. In exercise of powers conferred under section 3(3) of Electricity Act, 2003, the Central\nGovernment hereby notifies the revised Tariff Policy to be effective from the date of publication of this\nresolution in the Gazette of India.\nNotwithstanding anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken under the\nprovisions of the Tariff Policy notified on 6th January, 2006 and amendments made thereunder, shall, in so far\nas it is not inconsistent with this Policy, be deemed to have been done or taken under provisions of this revised\npolicy.\nThe National Electricity Policy has set the goal of adding new generation capacity and enhancing per capital\navailability of electricity per year and to not only eliminate energy and peaking shortages but to also have a\nspinning reserve as specified by the Central Electricity Authority. Development of the power sector has also to\nmeet the challenge of providing access for affordable electricity to all households in next five years.\nIt is therefore essential to attract adequate investments in the power sector by providing appropriate return on\ninvestment as budgetary resources of the Central and State Governments are incapable of providing the requisite\nfunds. It is equally necessary to ensure availability of electricity to different categories of consumers at\nreasonable rates for achieving the objectives of rapid economic development of the country and improvement in\nthe living standards of the people.\nBalancing the requirement of attracting adequate investments to the sector and that of ensuring reasonability of\nuser charges for the consumers is the critical challenge for the regulatory process. Accelerated development of\nthe power sector and its ability to attract necessary investments calls for, inter alia, consistent regulatory\napproach across the country. Consistency in approach becomes all the more necessary considering the large\nnumber of States and the diversities involved.\nLEGAL POSITION\nSection 3 (1) of the Electricity Act, 2003 empowers the Central Government to formulate the tariff policy. Section\n3(3) of the Act enables the Central Government to review or revise the tariff policy from time to time.\nCentral Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) and State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs)\nshall be guided by the tariff policy in discharging their functions including framing the regulations.\nRegulatory Commissions shall be guided by the principles and methodologies specified by the Central\nCommission for determination of tariff applicable to generating companies and transmission licensees.\nThe Forum of Regulators has been constituted by the Central Government under the provisions of the Act\nwhich would, inter alia, facilitate consistency in approach specially in the area of distribution.\n3.0 EVOLUTION OF THE POLICY"

They should take full account of flood risk, coastal change and water supply and\ndemand considerations. There is also a statutory duty requiring local authorities to include\npolicies in their local plans which help them adapt to climate change. \u00b98\n50. Every local authority area should have a clear local plan, which sets out how local people\nwant their community to develop. These should be consistent with the NPPF and will be used\nto judge planning applications and appeals. In preparing their local plans, local planning\nauthorities are under a duty to cooperate with neighbouring authorities and other public\nbodies on planning issues that cross administrative boundaries, like flooding.\n51. Under the NPPF, local planning authorities' local plans and decisions should steer\ndevelopment away from areas of flood risk where possible, taking into account the impacts of\nclimate change. Where there are no suitable and reasonably available sites in areas with a\nlower probability of flooding, new development should only be permitted if it will be safe and\nresilient to flooding. New developments should not increase flood risk elsewhere and where\npossible, overall flood risk should be reduced. Local plans should be supported by a Strategic\nFlood Risk Assessment, which also takes into account the impacts of climate change.\n52. Before local plans can be adopted, they are examined at a public inquiry conducted by\nan independent planning inspector, to decide whether the plan is 'sound'. To be sound, a\nlocal plan must be consistent with national policy (including on climate change) and based\non proportionate evidence. Local planning authorities are also required to undertake both\na sustainability appraisal to appraise the social, environmental and economic effects of a\nplan and a Strategic Flood Risk Assessment to assess the risks and impacts to an area\nfrom flooding from all sources, now and in the future, taking account of the impacts of\nclimate change. Local planning authorities must also publish monitoring reports on progress\nimplementing their local plans.\n53. The NPPF is supported by planning practice guidance to help secure effective local\nimplementation. However, the large amount of current planning practice guidance can\nmake it difficult for residents and businesses to work effectively with the planning system.\nA government review in 2012, led by Lord Taylor, recommended that planning practice\nguidance on climate change and flood risk should be a priority for re-issue in an updated\nand streamlined form, helping to make the planning system swifter and more accessible.\nThe government responded positively to this recommendation in its overall response to Lord"

This\nwill pave the way for open access\nto distribution networks. It will\nalso facilitate private generation that\nlimits its interface with the host\nutility to the use of the distribution"

The National Electricity Policy has set a target of addition of new generation capacity and increasing per capita availability of electricity every year and not only to meet the peak energy and peak shortage, but also to maintain the Spinning Reserve as specified by the Central Electricity Authority. The power sector also has to meet the challenge of facilitating the availability of affordable electricity to all households in the next five years. The Central and State Governments are unable to provide the required funds from the budgetary resources, hence it is imperative to provide suitable return on investment to attract investment in the power sector.

The CO\u2082 Act, the Emissions Trading Act, the energy strategy via measures in the Energy Efficiency Act and energy regulations for buildings all contributed to this. However, greenhouse gas emissions are not only caused locally, but also through the consumption of imported goods. For Liechtenstein with its highly globalized economy, these emissions generated abroad (so-called &quot;grey emissions&quot;) are of central importance - they account for more than twice the domestic emissions. Important drivers for reducing emissions are technological developments, digitization and green investments in the financial industry. As all countries gradually set increasingly ambitious climate targets as a result of the Paris climate agreement, new markets for innovation and technology developments will emerge over the next five to ten years."

In the future, we will position hydrogen as a new resource and involve a wide range of players, not just for passenger cars. On that basis, for example, in each field of utilization, transportation, and manufacturing, we estimate the size of the world market based on certain hypotheses, and take various measures as described below to promote decarbonization. , to strengthen industrial competitiveness. To that end, we will reduce the supply cost to 30 yen/Nm\u00b2 in 2030 (less than 1/3 of the current selling price) by 2030, and reduce the hydrogen power generation cost to below gas-fired power generation in 2050 (approximately 20 yen/Nm\u00b2 or less) by increasing the amount of hydrogen introduced. etc., to achieve a level that is sufficiently competitive with fossil fuels. With regard to the target volume, while recognizing that each country and region has different situations in terms of renewable energy potential and market size, it is important to establish the domestic hydrogen market early."

Accordingly, a large number of new hydropower plants is not expected, especially those of higher power. That is why the emphasis in the strategic documents is on wind and sun and the development of this potential, but special attention will be paid to environmental protection. A large part of Croatia is included in the Natura 2000 ecological network and, accordingly, when developing individual projects, attention will be paid to nature protection. The legislative framework (Environmental Protection Act and Regulation on strategic assessment of the impact of strategies, plans and programs on the environment?) clearly prescribes the procedure to protect the ecological network and reduce the negative impact on the environment. Projects that cause great damage to the environment, in accordance with the aforementioned legislation, cannot be realized regardless of all other parameters (need, economic impact, etc.). In accordance with this, the control of changes to projects that arise due to the change in technology is particularly strictly implemented.

Built in floor area for each household segment is estimated based on the aforementioned data and extensive discussions with experts and in the working group. The available data was extrapolated to arrive at the current and future built-up stock within each category of households. One room, two rooms, three rooms and more than 3 rooms segments cover 31%, 23%, 38% and 8% respectively in 2017 and it is assumed that similar trends would be followed for next ten years.

No-one will be forced to remove their existing boilers.\nInstead, we will grow the market for heat pumps through incentivising early adopters\nthrough Boiler Upgrade Scheme grants, proposing introduction of a market-based\nregulation on manufacturers 10 similar to that which has been successful in growing the\nmarket for electric vehicles, and phasing out the installation of the dirtiest and most\nexpensive fossil fuel systems and deployment in new buildings. This would be in line\nwith the natural replacement cycle, including any hydrogen ready boiler in any areas\nnot converting to hydrogen, to ensure all heating systems used in 2050 are compatible\nwith Net Zero.\n2. Setting a clear ambition for industry to reduce the costs of installing a heat\npump by at least 25-50% by 2025 and to ensure heat pumps are no more\nexpensive to buy and run than gas boilers by 2030: We understand that capital\ncosts can act as a barrier and that investment to refine technologies, supply and\ninstallation requires clear signals and market certainty. Therefore, working with\nindustry, we are setting out our ambition to see significant cost reductions. We know\nthat industry is ready to back these ambitions in response to the package of measures\nin this strategy and accompanying publications.\n3. Improving heat pump appeal by continuing to invest in research and innovation:\nTogether with industry we must continue to innovate to reduce the barriers to\ninstallation, making heat pumps beautifully designed, smaller, and easier to install and\nuse. We are investing in new innovation opportunities - as part of the Net Zero\nInnovation Portfolio - aimed at advancing heat electrification to support the\ndecarbonisation of homes. The \u00a360 million Net Zero Innovation Portfolio (NZIP) 'Heat\nPump Ready' Programme will support the development of innovation across the heat\npump sector, including to improve the consumer experience in installing and using a\nheat pump. This will build on our previous Energy Innovation Programme activities,\nsuch as the Electrification of Heat Demonstration Project and Green Home Finance\nInnovation Programme.\n4. Ensuring affordability by providing financial support to meet capital costs: Our\nambition is to ensure that the costs of decarbonising heat and buildings falls fairly\nacross society.

The most vulnerable regions and people are the most exposed to the harmful effects of climate change and environmental degradation. The transition towards a climate-neutral economy is a source of new economic opportunities, with significant potential for job creation, in particular in territories that currently depend on fossil fuels. It can also contribute to enhanced energy security and resilience. However, the transition may also trigger short term social and economic costs in territories undergoing heavy decarbonisation process, and already weakened by the disruptive economic and social effects of the COVID-19 crisis."

Bureaucratic hurdles for the expansion of renewable energies have been removed, payments have been raised, the states have been made to make clear expansion commitments and the prerequisites for accelerated expansion have been created overall. In addition, an important factor has been changed with the self-electricity privilege, which exempts from taxes on self-produced and consumed electricity, so that prices fall and the energy transition progresses."

Thus, it will expand the financial incentives to reduce carbon pollution across the economy.

In its communication of 11 December 2019 on the European Green Deal, the Commission set out a new growth strategy that aims to transform the Union into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy built on sustainable and rule-based free trade, where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050, where economic growth is decoupled from resource use and no person or place is left behind. It aims to protect, conserve and enhance the Union\u2019s natural capital, and protect the health and well-being of citizens and future generations from environment-related risks and impacts. Furthermore, the European Green Deal aims to provide citizens and future generations with, inter alia, fresh air, clean water, healthy soil and biodiversity. To that end, the communication of the Commission of 20 May 2020 on a EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030: Bringing nature back into our lives (the \u2018EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030\u2019) the communication of the Commission of 20 May 2020 on a Farm to Fork Strategy for a fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly food system (the \u2018Farm to Fork\u2019 strategy), the communication of the Commission of 16 July 2021 on a new EU Forest Strategy for 2030, the communication of the Commission of 12 May 2021 on the Pathway to a Healthy Planet for All, EU Action Plan: \u2018Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil\u2019 and other relevant strategies, such as the communication of the Commission of 30 June 2021 on a long-term Vision for the EU\u2019s Rural Areas \u2013 Towards stronger, connected, resilient and prosperous rural areas by 2040, developed under the European Green Deal, further highlight the importance of action on forest protection and resilience. In particular, the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 aims to protect nature and reverse the degradation of ecosystems. Finally, the communication of the Commission of 11 October 2018 on a sustainable Bioeconomy for Europe: Strengthening the connection between economy, society and the environment enhances the protection of the environment and ecosystems while addressing the growing demand for food, feed, energy, materials and products by seeking new ways to produce and consume."

The NPPF also outlines that new developments should promote sustainable transport, taking opportunities to promote walking, cycling and public transport. However, while many local plans already say the right things, they are not always followed consistently in planning decisions. Developments often do little or nothing meaningful to enable cycling and walking, or to be properly and efficiently accessible by public transport. Sometimes they make cycling and walking provision worse. We can and must do better."

Further amendments to the Tariff Policy were notified on 31 March, 2008, 20 January,\n2011 and 8th July, 2011. In exercise of powers conferred under section 3(3) of Electricity Act, 2003, the Central\nGovernment hereby notifies the revised Tariff Policy to be effective from the date of publication of this\nresolution in the Gazette of India.\nNotwithstanding anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken under the\nprovisions of the Tariff Policy notified on 6th January, 2006 and amendments made thereunder, shall, in so far\nas it is not inconsistent with this Policy, be deemed to have been done or taken under provisions of this revised\npolicy.\nThe National Electricity Policy has set the goal of adding new generation capacity and enhancing per capital\navailability of electricity per year and to not only eliminate energy and peaking shortages but to also have a\nspinning reserve as specified by the Central Electricity Authority. Development of the power sector has also to\nmeet the challenge of providing access for affordable electricity to all households in next five years.\nIt is therefore essential to attract adequate investments in the power sector by providing appropriate return on\ninvestment as budgetary resources of the Central and State Governments are incapable of providing the requisite\nfunds. It is equally necessary to ensure availability of electricity to different categories of consumers at\nreasonable rates for achieving the objectives of rapid economic development of the country and improvement in\nthe living standards of the people.\nBalancing the requirement of attracting adequate investments to the sector and that of ensuring reasonability of\nuser charges for the consumers is the critical challenge for the regulatory process. Accelerated development of\nthe power sector and its ability to attract necessary investments calls for, inter alia, consistent regulatory\napproach across the country. Consistency in approach becomes all the more necessary considering the large\nnumber of States and the diversities involved.\nLEGAL POSITION\nSection 3 (1) of the Electricity Act, 2003 empowers the Central Government to formulate the tariff policy. Section\n3(3) of the Act enables the Central Government to review or revise the tariff policy from time to time.\nCentral Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) and State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs)\nshall be guided by the tariff policy in discharging their functions including framing the regulations.\nRegulatory Commissions shall be guided by the principles and methodologies specified by the Central\nCommission for determination of tariff applicable to generating companies and transmission licensees.\nThe Forum of Regulators has been constituted by the Central Government under the provisions of the Act\nwhich would, inter alia, facilitate consistency in approach specially in the area of distribution.\n3.0 EVOLUTION OF THE POLICY"

It has \u00a322 billion of financing capacity to deploy and is aiming to invest across the capital structure, including senior debt, mezzanine, guarantees and equity. Projects must meet the Bank\u2019s investment principles of: supporting regional and local economic growth or helping to tackle climate change; being infrastructure assets or networks, or new infrastructure technology; delivering a positive financial return; and, crowding in significant private capital over time. The Bank\u2019s first strategic plan highlighted that it will explore how it can support the development of supply chains across its five priority sectors (clean energy, transport, digital, water and waste). UK Export Finance (UKEF) \u2013 As the UK\u2019s export credit agency, UKEF offers a range of financial products to support export. UKEF products can support eligible critical mineral projects, including UK-based projects with potential to export or overseas projects that present opportunities for export of UK goods and services."

Further amendments to the Tariff Policy were notified on 31 March, 2008, 20 January,\n2011 and 8th July, 2011. In exercise of powers conferred under section 3(3) of Electricity Act, 2003, the Central\nGovernment hereby notifies the revised Tariff Policy to be effective from the date of publication of this\nresolution in the Gazette of India.\nNotwithstanding anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken under the\nprovisions of the Tariff Policy notified on 6th January, 2006 and amendments made thereunder, shall, in so far\nas it is not inconsistent with this Policy, be deemed to have been done or taken under provisions of this revised\npolicy.\nThe National Electricity Policy has set the goal of adding new generation capacity and enhancing per capital\navailability of electricity per year and to not only eliminate energy and peaking shortages but to also have a\nspinning reserve as specified by the Central Electricity Authority. Development of the power sector has also to\nmeet the challenge of providing access for affordable electricity to all households in next five years.\nIt is therefore essential to attract adequate investments in the power sector by providing appropriate return on\ninvestment as budgetary resources of the Central and State Governments are incapable of providing the requisite\nfunds. It is equally necessary to ensure availability of electricity to different categories of consumers at\nreasonable rates for achieving the objectives of rapid economic development of the country and improvement in\nthe living standards of the people.\nBalancing the requirement of attracting adequate investments to the sector and that of ensuring reasonability of\nuser charges for the consumers is the critical challenge for the regulatory process. Accelerated development of\nthe power sector and its ability to attract necessary investments calls for, inter alia, consistent regulatory\napproach across the country. Consistency in approach becomes all the more necessary considering the large\nnumber of States and the diversities involved.\nLEGAL POSITION\nSection 3 (1) of the Electricity Act, 2003 empowers the Central Government to formulate the tariff policy. Section\n3(3) of the Act enables the Central Government to review or revise the tariff policy from time to time.\nCentral Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) and State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs)\nshall be guided by the tariff policy in discharging their functions including framing the regulations.\nRegulatory Commissions shall be guided by the principles and methodologies specified by the Central\nCommission for determination of tariff applicable to generating companies and transmission licensees.\nThe Forum of Regulators has been constituted by the Central Government under the provisions of the Act\nwhich would, inter alia, facilitate consistency in approach specially in the area of distribution.\n3.0 EVOLUTION OF THE POLICY"

In December 2019, the Government submitted the first climate policy action plan to the Riksdag, 'A Unified Policy for Climate - Climate Policy Action Plan' (Govt Bill 2019/20:65). In the action plan, the Government describes how climate policy work should be conducted during the electoral period, including the adopted and planned measures that contribute to achieving the national and global climate goals."

The most vulnerable regions and people are the most exposed to the harmful effects of climate change and environmental degradation. The transition towards a climate-neutral economy is a source of new economic opportunities, with significant potential for job creation, in particular in territories that currently depend on fossil fuels. It can also contribute to enhanced energy security and resilience. However, the transition may also trigger short term social and economic costs in territories undergoing heavy decarbonisation process, and already weakened by the disruptive economic and social effects of the COVID-19 crisis."

      "found_block": "(22) Furthermore, to achieve the Union\u2019s 2030 targets for energy and climate and its 2050 climate neutrality objective, the Union needs to significantly scale up renewable electricity generation. The existing energy infrastructure categories for electricity transmission and storage are crucial for the integration of the significant increase in renewable electricity generation in the power grid. In addition, that requires stepping up investment in offshore renewable energy with the aim of reaching at least 300 GW of offshore wind generation installed in line with the Commission\u2019s offshore renewable energy strategy set out in the Commission communication of 19\u00a0November 2020 entitled \u2018An EU Strategy to harness the potential of offshore renewable energy for a climate neutral future\u2019. That strategy includes radial links connecting new offshore wind capacities, as well as hybrid integrated projects. Coordinating long-term planning and development of offshore and onshore electricity grids should also be addressed. In particular, offshore infrastructure planning should move away from the project-by-project approach towards a coordinated comprehensive approach ensuring the sustainable development of integrated offshore grids in line with the offshore renewable potential of each sea basin, environmental protection and other uses of the sea. There should be an approach based on voluntary cooperation between Member States. Member States should remain responsible for approving the projects of common interest which are related to their territory and the related costs."

The government has been working to encourage greater private investment into the UK\u2019s zero emission vehicle supply chain. Battery manufacturing capacity will be an important component, alongside other technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells. BEIS established the Automotive Transformation Fund (ATF) with the aim of developing a globally competitive electric vehicle supply chain. The ATF provides support for late-stage R&D and capital investment in strategically important technologies, including battery manufacturing. We have already had success in securing investment. In July 2021, Envision AESC announced investment in a new gigafactory in Sunderland, which forms part of the \u00a31 billion North East Electric Vehicle Hub that also includes investment by Nissan in electric vehicle manufacturing. In January 2022, it was announced that intended government support for Britishvolt\u2019s gigafactory in Blyth, had unlocked \u00a31.7 billion of private investment. Recent investment by Stellantis and Bentley in electric vehicle manufacturing in the UK create further opportunities for the UK to continue to expand its battery manufacturing capabilities. In March, government published its automotive investor roadmap, which shows how it will work with industry to maintain the UK\u2019s leadership in zero emission vehicles. The roadmap will be used to support our work with business, investors and regulators to encourage investment into the UK automotive industry and its supply chain. Government is promoting opportunities for investment through its online tool, the Investment Atlas, as well as through dedicated investment promotion teams overseas. All this provides investors with a strong signal about the government\u2019s intention to position the UK as the place to invest in zero emission vehicle manufacturing and its supply chain."

The National Electricity Policy has set a target of addition of new generation capacity and increasing per capita availability of electricity every year and not only to meet the peak energy and peak shortage, but also to maintain the Spinning Reserve as specified by the Central Electricity Authority. The power sector also has to meet the challenge of facilitating the availability of affordable electricity to all households in the next five years.

The CO\u2082 Act, the Emissions Trading Act, the energy strategy via measures in the Energy Efficiency Act and energy regulations for buildings all contributed to this. However, greenhouse gas emissions are not only caused locally, but also through the consumption of imported goods. For Liechtenstein with its highly globalized economy, these emissions generated abroad (so-called &quot;grey emissions&quot;) are of central importance - they account for more than twice the domestic emissions. Important drivers for reducing emissions are technological developments, digitization and green investments in the financial industry. As all countries gradually set increasingly ambitious climate targets as a result of the Paris climate agreement, new markets for innovation and technology developments will emerge over the next five to ten years."

My Administration is also committed to combating illegal logging and stopping trade in illegally sourced wood products pursuant to the Lacey Act, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq., and to addressing the related importation of commodities sourced from recently deforested land. To further advance these commitments, conserve these critical ecosystems, and address drivers of global deforestation \u2014 including illegal forest clearing to produce agricultural commodities \u2014 the following actions shall be taken:"

In the future, we will position hydrogen as a new resource and involve a wide range of players, not just for passenger cars. On that basis, for example, in each field of utilization, transportation, and manufacturing, we estimate the size of the world market based on certain hypotheses, and take various measures as described below to promote decarbonization. , to strengthen industrial competitiveness. To that end, we will reduce the supply cost to 30 yen/Nm\u00b2 in 2030 (less than 1/3 of the current selling price) by 2030, and reduce the hydrogen power generation cost to below gas-fired power generation in 2050 (approximately 20 yen/Nm\u00b2 or less) by increasing the amount of hydrogen introduced. etc., to achieve a level that is sufficiently competitive with fossil fuels. With regard to the target volume, while recognizing that each country and region has different situations in terms of renewable energy potential and market size, it is important to establish the domestic hydrogen market early."

Coal-fired power will be developed in coordination with power supplies and peak shaving capacities, so as to strictly control coal-fired power generation projects. Upgrades and power flexibility retrofitting projects should be accelerated for existing coal power generators. The burning of bulk coal will be gradually phased out before the introduction of a complete ban. Scaled development of unconventional oil and gas resources such as shale gas, coal bed gas, and tight oil and gas will pick up pace. Risk management must be enhanced to ensure a stable and safe energy supply and a smooth transition."

This\nindicative target would be consistent with RMI's straight-line intended\nNDC emissions reduction trajectory from the 2025 target to net zero in\n2050, and so represents consistent momentum in RMI's GHG\nemissions reductions efforts.\n11. By specifying that targets in its future NDC will be \"at least\" targets, RMI will send\na clear signal of intent to try to overachieve against them, and that they are a floor\nfor ambition, not a ceiling. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that achieving\neven RMI's existing ambitious NDC targets will require the necessary means of\nimplementation to be available. Going beyond these and overachieving against\ntargets will clearly require the availability of further means of implementation. At\nthe same time, the transition to renewable energy could present net future cost\nsavings from reduced imports of fossil fuels and bring other co-benefits, for\nexample.\n12. It is worth pointing out that RMI has already undertaken significant steps to\nreduce its GHG emissions. Its emissions peaked in 2009, and the National Energy\nPolicy and Energy Action Plan identifies a comprehensive list of strategies to\nfurther reduce GHG emissions. To maintain this momentum, this 2050 Strategy\nrecommends undertaking studies and pilot projects, which focus on the actions\nwith the highest potential to transform RMI's energy usage and accelerate the\nshift away from emissions-intensive practices, towards net zero emissions by\n2050.\n13. With strategic and adaptive management, RMI can achieve significant emissions\nreductions and solidify its climate leadership position. In its 2009 and 2016\nNational Energy Plans, RMI outlined national goals for energy use that move the\ncountry toward achievement of its 100% decarbonization vision by 2050. The\nelectricity sector has by far the greatest potential to rapidly reduce RMI's GHG\nemissions in line with its 2025 and 2030 NDC targets. The pathway to a"

It also aims to protect, conserve and enhance the Union's natural capital, and protect the health and well-being of Union citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. The Green Deal aims to decouple economic growth from resource use, and ensure that all regions and Union citizens participate in a socially just transition to a sustainable economic system whereby no person and no place is left behind. It will contribute to the objective of building an economy that works for the people, strengthening the Union\u2019s social market economy, helping to ensure that it is ready for the future and that it delivers stability, jobs, growth and sustainable investment."

The current energy infrastructure investments are clearly insufficient to transform and build the energy infrastructure of the future. That also means infrastructure needs to be in place to support the European energy transition, including rapid electrification, scaling up of renewable and fossil fuel free electricity generation, the increased use of renewable and low-carbon gases, energy system integration and a higher uptake of innovative solutions."

To\nensure that the country will prepare itself, now is a good time to consider the long-term\nimplications of the transition. This long-term strategy has been written with this objective in mind."

Development of the power sector has also to meet the\nchallenge of providing access for electricity to all households in next five years.\nIt is therefore essential to attract adequate investments in the power sector by\nproviding appropriate return on investment as budgetary resources of the Central\nand State Governments are incapable of providing the requisite funds.

None of these are\nstandalone aspirations. Rather, they are all deeply inter-connected strategic objectives.\nThe Fijian Government has already mapped out - in great detail - exactly how we plan\nto implement our development agenda through Fiji's 5-Year and 20-Year National\nDevelopment Plan. Those plans outline the way forward for Fiji in realising both\nthe Sustainable Development Goals and the targets of our Nationally Determined\nContribution to reduce carbon emissions under the Paris Agreement. Those plans both\nacknowledge and account for the impacts of our changing climate. However, this accompanying policy, Fiji's Nationa\nClimate Change Policy 2018-2030 (NCCP), presents a more detailed and deliberate articulation of Fiji's priorities in\nreducing present and future climate risks, while maximising our long-term gains in development.\nHon.

As the Presider\nof COP23, Fiji led the global climate negotiations to serious progress in implementing the Paris Agreement and\nlaunched both the Ocean Pathway Partnership and the landmark Talanoa Call for Action. The key to Fiji's success ha\nalways been our unwavering commitment to a multi-sector approach, one that considers all perspectives and seizes\non opportunities to exploit synergies between different actors to implement shared priorities.\nIn similar fashion, this policy document sets out a \"woven approach\" to resilient development that seeks to deepen\nengagement between different actors, from governments, to civil society organisations, to the private sector, to\nindividual citizens. By putting forward new forms of collaboration, this document streamlines traditional roles and\nresponsibilities by capitalising on natural commonalities and expands access to an ever-growing body of knowledge\nand experiences by aligning incentives and values in pursuit of a collective vision for a more resilient Fiji.

The CO\u2082 Act, the Emissions Trading Act, the energy strategy via measures in the Energy Efficiency Act and energy regulations for buildings all contributed to this. However, greenhouse gas emissions are not only caused locally, but also through the consumption of imported goods. For Liechtenstein with its highly globalized economy, these emissions generated abroad (so-called &quot;grey emissions&quot;) are of central importance - they account for more than twice the domestic emissions. Important drivers for reducing emissions are technological developments, digitization and green investments in the financial industry. As all countries gradually set increasingly ambitious climate targets as a result of the Paris climate agreement, new markets for innovation and technology developments will emerge over the next five to ten years."

The government has committed to stretching carbon reduction targets up to the end of the Sixth Carbon Budget in 2037 and by 2050. As the largest emitting sector, transport will need to make a sizeable contribution if these targets are to be met. Depending on progress in the sector at some points this may require additional targeted action (such as steps to reduce use of the most polluting cars and tackle urban congestion) to enable these targets to be met. We will regularly review progress against our targets, continue to adapt and take further action if needed to decarbonise transport. We will publish our progress and review our pathway at least every five years."
