      "found_block": "The Energy Strategy 2050, which aims to transform energy supply, makes a major contribution to at-\ntaining the climate policy goals. A significant expansion of renewable energies - such as hydropower,\nphotovoltaic systems, biomass, geothermal energy and wind energy - is planned in the field of power\ngeneration. In addition to efficiency measures, more domestic renewable energies are to replace fossil\nenergies in the area of heating. To consolidate the expansion of renewable energies, the Federal Coun-\ncil wishes - based on the results of a consultation procedure on an amendment to the Energy Act - to\npartially extend the support to 2035, on one hand, and to give it a more competitive structure on the\nother. It also wishes to turn the statutory limits for electricity generation from hydropower and other\nrenewable energies of at least 54.4 TWh for 2035 into binding targets and to also define targets for\n2050. By opening up the electricity market to all customers, the Federal Council also intends to better\nintegrate renewable energies into the market and to strengthen the position of decentralised electricity\nproduction to enable innovative services, such as district system solutions and electric mobility pack-\nages, to be created."
