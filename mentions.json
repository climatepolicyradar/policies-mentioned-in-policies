Based on the concept of \u201cadaptation and recovery\u201d that promotes adaptation to climate change by means of disasters, we aim to create a society that \u201cavoids disasters and restores them immediately.\u201d For this reason, in order to be able to respond promptly after a disaster, it is also possible to look ahead to the future before the disaster strikes, examine and share pictures of post-recovery society and towns with the community, and aim for &quot;better recovery&quot; by promoting pre-recovery efforts.

There is a high value attached to personal use as well as possible\nproductive use of electricity and there is willingness to pay for it.

This has been developed by CERC taking into\nconsideration the advice of the CEA. Sharing of transmission charges shall be done in accordance with such tariff\nmechanism as amended from time to time.\n(3) Transmission charges, under this framework, can be determined on MW per circuit kilometer basis, zonal\npostage stamp basis, or some other pragmatic variant, the ultimate objective being to get the transmission system users\nto share the total transmission cost in proportion to their respective utilization of the transmission system. The\nutilization factor should duly capture the advantage of reliability reaped by all. The spread between minimum and\nmaximum transmission rates should be such as not to inhibit planned development/augmentation of the transmission\nsystem but should discourage non-optimal transmission investment.\nIn view of the approach laid down by the NEP, prior agreement with the beneficiaries would not be a pre-\ncondition for network expansion. CTU/STU should undertake network expansion after identifying the requirements in\nconsonance with the National Electricity Plan and in consultation with stakeholders and taking up the execution after\ndue regulatory approvals. For smooth operation of the grid, efforts should be made to develop transmission system\nahead of generation.\n(5) The Central Commission has specified norms for capital and operating costs and laid down Standards of\nPerformance for inter-State transmission licensees. Tariff determination and adherence to Standards of Performance\nshall be carried out in accordance with these norms, as amended from time to time.\n(6) Investment by transmission developer including CTU/STUs would be invited through competitive bids in\naccordance with the guidelines issued by the Central Government from time to time.\n(7) While all future inter-state transmission projects shall, ordinarily, be developed through competitive\nbidding process, the Central Government may give exemption from competitive bidding for (a) specific category of\nprojects of strategic importance, technical upgradation etc. or (b) works required to be done to cater to an urgent\nsituation on a case to case basis.\n(8) CERC has specified Regulation on framework for the inter-State transmission.

While it is often agreed that all segments of this business\nneed to be profitable, proper pricing of electricity has been a challenge.\nSurveys have revealed that those yet un-electrified desperately seek electricity\nnot only for the quality life but also for its productive use to raise income\nlevels. There is a high value attached to personal use as well as possible\nproductive use of electricity and there is willingness to pay for it. The Tariff\nPolicy and National Electricity Plans have successively highlighted the need to\nsupply quality power at appropriate price. By not doing so, we have placed our\nindustry at a great disadvantage. Sectors in which electricity cost is a\nsignificant proportion of the total cost are particularly disadvantaged.

That ambition was endorsed by the European Council on 11\u00a0December 2020 and the impact assessment accompanying that communication confirms that the energy mix of the future will be very different from the one of today and underpins the necessity to review and if necessary to revise the energy legislation. The current energy infrastructure investments are clearly insufficient to transform and build the energy infrastructure of the future. That also means infrastructure needs to be in place to support the European energy transition, including rapid electrification, scaling up of renewable and fossil fuel free electricity generation, the increased use of renewable and low-carbon gases, energy system integration and a higher uptake of innovative solutions."

There is a double urgency for this: On the one hand, the climate crisis is coming to a head. On the other hand, Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine, in violation of international law, shows how important it is to phase out fossil fuels and push ahead with the expansion of renewables. Renewable energies have now become a question of national security. The Easter package is the biggest energy policy amendment in decades. It will comprehensively accelerate the expansion of renewable energies, on water, on land and on the roof. Which laws will be amended? \u2022 The Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), \u2022 the Offshore Wind Energy Act (WindSee G), \u2022 the Energy Industry Act (EnWG), the Federal Requirements Plan Act (BBPIG), \u2022 the Grid Expansion Acceleration Act (NABEG) and other laws and ordinances in the energy law. What measures are taken? \u2022 The core of the package is the principle that the use of renewable energies is in the overriding public interest and serves public safety. \u2022 The expansion of renewable energies on land and at sea will be raised to a completely new level, so that the power supply in Germany will be based almost entirely on renewable energies as early as 2035. A comprehensive package of measures is being taken to promote the expansion of renewables. For example, o new areas will be made available for the expansion of photovoltaics, o the participation of the municipalities in onshore wind and photovoltaics will be expanded, o locations with weak winds will be developed to a greater extent, and o the framework conditions for the expansion of photovoltaic roof systems will be improved."

This has been developed by CERC taking into\nconsideration the advice of the CEA. Sharing of transmission charges shall be done in accordance with such tariff\nmechanism as amended from time to time.\n(3) Transmission charges, under this framework, can be determined on MW per circuit kilometer basis, zonal\npostage stamp basis, or some other pragmatic variant, the ultimate objective being to get the transmission system users\nto share the total transmission cost in proportion to their respective utilization of the transmission system. The\nutilization factor should duly capture the advantage of reliability reaped by all. The spread between minimum and\nmaximum transmission rates should be such as not to inhibit planned development/augmentation of the transmission\nsystem but should discourage non-optimal transmission investment.\nIn view of the approach laid down by the NEP, prior agreement with the beneficiaries would not be a pre-\ncondition for network expansion.

Tariff determination and adherence to Standards of Performance\nshall be carried out in accordance with these norms, as amended from time to time.\n(6) Investment by transmission developer including CTU/STUs would be invited through competitive bids in\naccordance with the guidelines issued by the Central Government from time to time.\n(7) While all future inter-state transmission projects shall, ordinarily, be developed through competitive\nbidding process, the Central Government may give exemption from competitive bidding for (a) specific category of\nprojects of strategic importance, technical upgradation etc. or (b) works required to be done to cater to an urgent\nsituation on a case to case basis.\n(8) CERC has specified Regulation on framework for the inter-State transmission. A similar approach should be\nimplemented by SERCS for the intra-State transmission, duly considering factors like voltage, distance, direction and\nquantum of flow."

There is a double urgency for this: On the one hand, the climate crisis is coming to a head. On the other hand, Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine, in violation of international law, shows how important it is to phase out fossil fuels and push ahead with the expansion of renewables. Renewable energies have now become a question of national security. The Easter package is the biggest energy policy amendment in decades. It will comprehensively accelerate the expansion of renewable energies, on water, on land and on the roof. Which laws will be amended? \u2022 The Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), \u2022 the Offshore Wind Energy Act (WindSee G), \u2022 the Energy Industry Act (EnWG), the Federal Requirements Plan Act (BBPIG), \u2022 the Grid Expansion Acceleration Act (NABEG) and other laws and ordinances in the energy law. What measures are taken? \u2022 The core of the package is the principle that the use of renewable energies is in the overriding public interest and serves public safety. \u2022 The expansion of renewable energies on land and at sea will be raised to a completely new level, so that the power supply in Germany will be based almost entirely on renewable energies as early as 2035. A comprehensive package of measures is being taken to promote the expansion of renewables. For example, o new areas will be made available for the expansion of photovoltaics, o the participation of the municipalities in onshore wind and photovoltaics will be expanded, o locations with weak winds will be developed to a greater extent, and o the framework conditions for the expansion of photovoltaic roof systems will be improved."

In its communication of 17\u00a0September 2020 entitled \u2018Stepping up Europe\u2019s 2030 climate ambition \u2013 Investing in a climate-neutral future for the benefit of our people\u2019, the Commission proposed to increase the greenhouse gas emissions reduction target to at least 55\u00a0% by 2030. That ambition was endorsed by the European Council on 11\u00a0December 2020 and the impact assessment accompanying that communication confirms that the energy mix of the future will be very different from the one of today and underpins the necessity to review and if necessary to revise the energy legislation. The current energy infrastructure investments are clearly insufficient to transform and build the energy infrastructure of the future. That also means infrastructure needs to be in place to support the European energy transition, including rapid electrification, scaling up of renewable and fossil fuel free electricity generation, the increased use of renewable and low-carbon gases, energy system integration and a higher uptake of innovative solutions."
